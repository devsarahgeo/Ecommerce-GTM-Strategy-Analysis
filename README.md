# 🛒 Olist Ecommerce ETL Pipeline & GTM Analysis (Work in progres)

## 🧭 Executive Summary 
<p>
A friend who works as a manager at <b>Olist</b> shared their marketplace data with me. <b>I noticed</b> inconsistencies and gaps in order volumes, high cancellation rates, and unclear patterns in repeat buyers, which made it difficult to understand marketplace performance. 

To address this, I analyzed the data focusing on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), order volume, cancellations, and repeat buyers. This analysis highlights top-performing sellers, revenue-driving product categories, and patterns in customer behavior, providing actionable insights to guide business decisions and improve operational efficiency.

### 💼 Business Problem
<p>
Olist marketplace wanted to understand trends in order volumes, cancellations, and repeat buyers over time, as these metrics affect revenue and customer retention. Without this insight, management cannot identify growth opportunities or operational challenges.
  
Specifically, they need to know:
<ul>
  <li> Which sellers and product categories drive the most GMV and revenue?</li>
  
  <li> How order volumes and cancellations are trending month-to-month?</li>
  
  <li> How repeat customers behave and which segments are most valuable?</li>
</ul

Answering these questions helps the business identify growth opportunities, reduce operational issues (like cancellations), and improve customer retention.

In short: "How can the marketplace increase revenue, reduce cancellations, and retain more customers?"
